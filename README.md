# konj
_n. portmanteau of kana, conv(ert) and japanese_

Convert between various Japanese scripts (`hiragana`, `katakana`, `romaji`)

# current status

Basic conversion from `romaji` to `hiragana`, `katakana`

# next steps

* ~~handle capital letters in romaji input~~
* ~~handle whitespace in romaji input~~
* ~~handle punctuation: , and .~~
* output json (flag)
* make the program unix-pipe-able only
* code cleanup:
  * ~~refactor generic transformation fns~~
  * ~~move out the static maps into another namepsace~~
  * lazy load the maps once during the program lifetime

# upcoming

- Handle mixed-input (hiragana + romaji etc.)
- Conversion from any input to all other inputs
    * hiragana → romaji, katakana
    * katakana → romaji, hiragana
- Conversion from Kana to Kanji 
    * this would most likely be something like [henkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_input_keys#Conversion) in IMEs
